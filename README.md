Problem in question:

> Problem b: The Collatz Problem
> Suppose we take a number n and do the following transformation:

>    n → n/2 if n is even,
 >   n → 3n+1 if n is odd.

>Applying this rule starting with n=13 and stopping when we reach 1 generates the following sequence

  >  13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1.

>We call this the Collatz sequence for 13, and it has 10 terms (including 13 and 1 themselves). Starting at different >
numbers gives Collatz sequences of different lengths. For example, the sequence starting at n=97 has 119 terms, which is the longest sequence with starting number less than 100.

>It is thought that every Collatz sequence will eventually arrive at 1 (the Collatz conjecture) but it has not yet been proved!

>Which starting number under 10,000 has the longest Collatz sequence? Note that although the starting number must be less than 10,000, the numbers in the sequence might get much bigger than 10,000.

>Write a program in a programming language of your choice that solves this problem. The program must compute the answer itself (do not solve the problem by hand!) and it must print the answer to the standard output.
